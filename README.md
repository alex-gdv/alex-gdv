### hello there ðŸ‘‹

i'm a machine learning engineer based in London.
at the moment, i'm excited and passionate about reinforcement learning and how NNs train.

currently, a peer and i are working on the Kaggle competition [_NeurIPS 2023 - Machine Unlearning_](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-2023-machine-unlearning). 
you can find the project in my pinned repos.

i have been hopping back and forth between the following books: 
[_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python_](https://www.statlearning.com/), 
[_Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/), 
and [_Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).

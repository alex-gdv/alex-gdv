### hello there ðŸ‘‹

i'm a machine learning research engineer based in London.
i'm passionate about machine learning, cool data science projects, and challenging software engineering problems.

currently, i'm open to new opportunities.
please get in contact if you're interested: alex-gdv@proton.me

currently, a peer and i are working on the Kaggle competition [_NeurIPS 2023 - Machine Unlearning_](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-2023-machine-unlearning). 
you can find the project in my pinned repos.

i have been hopping back and forth between the following books: 
[_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python_](https://www.statlearning.com/), 
[_Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/), 
and [_Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).

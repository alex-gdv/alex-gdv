### hello there ðŸ‘‹

i'm a research-oriented machine learning engineer based in London, UK and Sevilla, Spain.
i lead the research and development of an ML system for renewable energy site assessment at [Local Energy Systems](https://www.localenergysystems.co.uk/).

i enjoy...
- learning about ML theory, particularly optimisation methods and reinforcement learning,
- reading and presenting research papers,
- going down rabbit holes and learning anything and everything about a problem,
- and spending time with kind and intelligent people.

currently, a peer and i are working on the Kaggle competition [_NeurIPS 2023 - Machine Unlearning_](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-2023-machine-unlearning). 
you can find the project in my pinned repos. i'm also aiming to contribute to PyTorch!
